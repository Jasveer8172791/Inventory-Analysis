### Project Overview: 

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization techniques, and SQL-based querying. It also includes a Power BI dashboard for effective data presentation.

#### Files are in this Project: 

Final_Cleaned_Sale_data.csv: A cleaned dataset containing sales data for analysis.

EDA_&_Visualization_Part.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis and visualization.

My_SQL_Project_1.pbix: A Power BI file containing interactive dashboards and reports.

MySQL_Connection_File :  How I did connection Between MYSQL with my python jupyter.

### Technologies Used: 

#### Python: 
***With the help of Python I got some key insights like:***

## Technologies Used: 

#### Python(Numpy,pandas,matplotlib, sqlalchemy create_engine,)

Using Python, we extracted key insights such as:

Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, Average Price per Unit, Gross Profit after Tax

Average Order Value (AOV) Distribution, Revenue per Customer Distribution

Top 10 Brands, Products, and Vendors by Sales Revenue

Sales Distribution by Classification

#### MySQL: 

Data was stored in MySQL for structured querying.
Queries were executed in both Python (Jupyter Notebook) and MySQL Workbench to validate insights.

#### Power BI: 
Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights.
The dashboard dynamically updates as SQL data changes.

### Project Deliverables

1.SQL Database: A fully populated SQL database with cleaned data.

2.Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard showcasing inventory insights.

3.GitHub Repository: Well-documented code, SQL schema, and project instructions.

### Setup Instructions: 

Setuped MySQL Database:

Created the necessary tables using the provided SQL schema.

Loaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL.

Connected Power BI to MySQL Database:

Imported data from MySQL.

Created visualizations and configure automatic refresh intervals.

Validate Real-time Updates:
Done data modifications in MySQL are reflected in Power BI.
